# RobortControlPanel
In this repository i have been done two tasks all about the robot arm control panel.
The first one , i designed interface for the robot arm and i share the HTML code that include all the motors values 
and two buttons one for save the work and the other one for turn it on.
Also i posted the CSS code that i designed all the control panel on it by choosing the background color , font align , colors ,and sliders.
The last thing i create a javascript code to print the values.

The last tasks that i have been done , i created table on database by using the XAMPP that has 9 columns :
1:ID
2:Motor1
3:Motor2
4:Motor3
5:Motor4
6:Motor5
7:Motor6
8:on
9:save
then i connected this database with HTML code for the control panel using the PHP code. 
i follow these steps before setting the table on database , open the XAMPP folder -> open "htdocs" -> create new folder and save on this new folder the HTML code file and PHP code file -> open the broswer : localhost\*write the name of the new folder*
finally , i tried to send the values to the database to check if my PHP code running or not.
